In this project, I am using the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
